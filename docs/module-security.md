# Module security
Any modules you choose to install have the potential to cause serious security problems for your server. This could include (but is not limited to):
- Unexpectedly modifying database data
- Transmitting personal data to external parties
- Crashing the server
- Erasing of entire hard-disk contents

**If in doubt, leave it out!**
